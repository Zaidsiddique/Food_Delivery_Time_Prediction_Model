we are working with a food delivery dataset. It contains data like:

Features	Example
Delivery Time (target)	30 minutes
Weather	Sunny, Rainy, Stormy
Traffic	High, Low, Jam
Order Date	2024-01-20 14:00
Distance, Prep Time	2.5 km, 20 minutes

 What is the goal?
You want to predict the delivery time (in minutes) before the delivery happens.

That means:

We will train a machine learning model

So that it learns: “If it’s rainy and traffic is jammed, delivery takes longer.”

Later, we can use that model to predict new orders' delivery times

The steps we take
Let’s break this into 6 easy stages

 1. Load the data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("food_delivery_data.csv")
print(df.head())
You load the data to see whats inside.

 2. Understand the data (EDA :- Exploratory Data Analysis)
Use plots and .describe() to see

What is the average delivery time?

Does rain or traffic affect it?

Corellation 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.boxplot(x="Weather_Conditions", y="Delivery_Time_min", data=df)
plt.show()

 3. Clean the data
Fix missing values

Convert strings like "Rainy" to numbers (model only understands numbers)

df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=["Weather", "Road_Traffic"], drop_first=True)
 4. Split into inputs and outputs

X = df.drop("Delivery_Time_min", axis=1)  # Inputs
y = df["Delivery_Time_min"]               # Output we want to predict
 5. Train the model

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Now the model learns from data.

 6. Make predictions

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)) (MAE :- Mean Absolute Error)
print("RMSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) ** 0.5) (RMSE :- Root Mean Squared Error )


In Simple Words
You teach the computer:

“If I order food at 8 PM, on a rainy day, with heavy traffic, it takes about 45 mins.”

Then it learns from your past data, and can predict future deliveries automatically.
